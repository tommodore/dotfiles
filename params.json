{"name":"Dotfiles","tagline":"Yet another dotfile repo","body":"# Dotfile Management\r\n\r\nAutomates installation and configuration of your home directory dotfiles.\r\nWorks for various Linux distributions and MacOSX.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Initial setup\r\n\r\nRun this:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/tommodore/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles\r\ncd ~/.dotfiles\r\nscript/bootstrap\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will:\r\n* symlinks the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory\r\n* loads vim Plugin Manager Vundle as a submodule\r\n* installs or update Vundle plugins configured in `.dofiles/vim/vimrc.symlink`\r\n* installs homebrew - if you're on a mac\r\n\r\n### Update Vim Plugins only\r\n\r\nLaunch `vim` and run `:PluginInstall!`\r\n\r\nTo install or update from command line: `vim +PluginInstall! +qall`\r\n\r\n## What's inside\r\n\r\nA lot of stuff. Seriously, a lot of stuff. Check them out in the file browser\r\nabove and see what components may mesh up with you.\r\n[Fork it](https://github.com/tommodore/dotfiles/fork), remove what you don't\r\nuse, and build on what you do use.\r\n\r\n## Components\r\n\r\nThere are a few special files in the hierarchy.\r\n\r\n- **bin/**: Anything in `bin/` will get added to your `$PATH` and be made\r\n  available everywhere.\r\n- **topic/\\*.zsh**: Any files ending in `.zsh` get loaded into your\r\n  environment.\r\n- **topic/path.zsh**: Any file named `path.zsh` is loaded first and is\r\n  expected to setup `$PATH` or similar.\r\n- **topic/completion.zsh**: Any file named `completion.zsh` is loaded\r\n  last and is expected to setup autocomplete.\r\n- **topic/\\*.symlink**: Any files ending in `*.symlink` get symlinked into\r\n  your `$HOME`. This is so you can keep all of those versioned in your dotfiles\r\n  but still keep those autoloaded files in your home directory. These get\r\n  symlinked in when you run `script/bootstrap`.\r\n\r\n## Bugs\r\n\r\nI want this to work for everyone; that means when you clone it down it should\r\nwork for you even though you may not have `rbenv` installed, for example. That\r\nsaid, I do use this as *my* dotfiles, so there's a good chance I may break\r\nsomething if I forget to make a check for a dependency.\r\n\r\nIf you're brand-new to the project and run into any blockers, please\r\n[open an issue](https://github.com/tommodore/dotfiles/issues) on this repository\r\nand I'd love to get it fixed for you!\r\n\r\nThanks to\r\n---------\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/holman/dotfiles\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sindresorhus/pure\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim\r\n\r\nand all the plugin developers\r\n","google":"UA-46327270-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
